# 🌟 Markdown Mapper: Navigate Your Docs with Ease! 📚

Welcome to Markdown Mapper! Say goodbye to the hassle of scrolling through endless pages of documentation trying to find what you need. Our scripts generate a table of contents for your markdown files, making it easy to navigate through even the most extensive projects.

## 🎯 Purpose

As I was writing documentation for Nuru, I realized I had to keep updating the table of contents, which is a boring task and hence this script.
These scripts are the perfect tools for:
- 📝 Creating an organized table of contents for your documentation projects 
- 🚀 Streamlining your workflow by organizing markdown files with headings and subheadings 
- 🔄 Quickly updating your table of contents when new files or headings are added 

## 🏃‍♀️ How to Run

We've got you covered no matter what programming language you prefer! Here's how to run each script:
🐍 For Python users

- Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system 🐍
- Open up your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script 📂
- Run the script using this command: python table_of_contents_generator.py 🚀

## 🐹 For Go users

- Make sure you have Go installed on your system 🐹
- Open up your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script 📂
- Run the script using this command: go run table_of_contents_generator.go 🚀
